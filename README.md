# bluebonnets

This is a passion project idea, just gallaries of my wife's favorite flower, the Texas Bluebonnet. 
A symbol of strength and pride, the Texas Bluebonnet is a beautiful flower that identifies the state itself.
This site was made to cheer her up when she's homesick, so maybe the beauty and simplicty will do the same for you!

This project was built using Bootstrap Studio, as I learn more professional grade industry standard technologies.
The contact form is merely for aesthetics, it does not operate at this time, although I will work to get it up and running
when I'm able to, unless someone else wants to do so for me.

Thanks for stopping by and happy coding!
